Each assertion should start with defining the service that's sending requests to the Database you want to check. You do this by:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('service-name'))...
```

These are the options you can use for service selection:

- `serviceByName` - the name of the service as reported in the `service.name` attribute
  (automatically reported by [Traceloop's init container](/jest-otel/no-otel))
- `serviceByK8sPodName` - the name of the pod as reported by Kubernetes
- `serviceByCustomAttribute` - any custom attribute reported by your service to OpenTelemetry

Following that, you can use any of the following assertions:

- `toQueryPostgreSQL`

Then, you can specifically assert for each of the properties of the request:

- `withDatabaseName`
- `withStatement`

So, a complete assertion can look like:

```js
expectTrace(traceloop.serviceByName('orders-service'))
  .toQueryPostgreSQL()
  .withDatabaseName('postgres')
  .withOperations('INSERT')
  .withTables('orders')
  .withStatement(
    /INSERT INTO orders \(id, price_in_cents\) VALUES \('[0-9A-Fa-f]{8}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{4}-[0-9A-Fa-f]{12}', [0-9]+\)/,
    { compareType: COMPARE_TYPE.REGEX },
  )
  .withPartialQuery('INSERT INTO orders (id, price_in_cents)');
